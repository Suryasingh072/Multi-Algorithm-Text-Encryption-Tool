🧠 Multi-Algorithm Text Encryption Tool

A Streamlit web app to encrypt and decrypt text using three powerful algorithms — AES, DES, and RSA.
Designed for secure data protection and learning cryptography concepts.

🚀 Features

🔒 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – Fast and secure symmetric encryption

🧩 DES (Data Encryption Standard) – Legacy symmetric encryption for demo purposes

🔑 RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) – Asymmetric encryption with public/private keys

🌐 Streamlit Interface – Interactive and user-friendly

📋 Copy or download encrypted/decrypted text easily

🧠 Great for learning encryption and cybersecurity basics

🧩 How It Works

Choose an encryption algorithm (AES, DES, or RSA).

Enter your text input and key (if required).

Click Encrypt to convert plain text into ciphertext.

Click Decrypt to restore the original message.

For RSA, the app automatically generates a key pair.

🖥️ How to Run

Install Python 3.8 or higher

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:

streamlit run app.py


Open your browser at http://localhost:8501

🔐 Security Notes

AES key must be 16 characters (128-bit)

DES key must be 8 characters (64-bit)

RSA generates public/private keys automatically

Keep private keys secure
